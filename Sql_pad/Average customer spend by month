Write a query to return the average customer spend by month.
Definition: average customer spend: total customer spend divided by the unique number of customers for that month.
Use EXTRACT(YEAR from ts_field) and EXTRACT(MONTH from ts_field) to get year and month from a timestamp column.
The order of your results doesn't matter.

SELECT 
      Extract(Year from payment_ts) as year,
	  Extract(Month from payment_ts) as month,
	  sum(Amount)/count(Distinct(customer_id)) as Avg_spend
FROM payment
Group By 2,1;
