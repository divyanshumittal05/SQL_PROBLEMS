Write a query to return the total number of unique customers for each month
Use EXTRACT(YEAR from ts_field) and EXTRACT(MONTH from ts_field) to get year and month from a timestamp column.
The order of your results doesn't matter.

SELECT 
      Extract(Year from rental_ts) as year,
	  Extract(month from rental_ts) as month,
	  count(distinct(customer_id))
FROM rental
group by 2,1;
